After controlling for data snooping and various market frictions, we find that statistically significant positive excess returns are rarely achieved, independent of the data sampling frequency, type of trading position, or test significance level. Also, cross-sectional performance is correlated with risk factors such as beta and idiosyncratic volatility, implying that trading rules mostly capture market risk premiums. Overall, trading rules do not seem to provide additional benefits in cryptocurrency markets compared to traditional financial markets.}

	abstract = { AbstractThis study examines the impact of investor sentiment on cryptocurrency returns. We use a direct survey-based measure that captures the investors’ sentiment on Bitcoins. This direct measure of Bitcoin investor sentiment is obtained from the Sentix database. The results of the study found that the Bitcoin prices experience appreciation when investors are optimistic about Bitcoin. Bitcoin sentiment has significant power in predicting the Bitcoin prices after controlling for the relevant factors. There is also evidence that the sentiment of the dominant cryptocurrency, i.e., Bitcoin, influences the price of other cryptocurrencies. Further, we extend our analysis by investigating the impact of equity market sentiment on cryptocurrency returns. We proxy equity market sentiment using two measures viz: Baker-Wurgler sentiment Index and the VIX Index. When the equity market investors’ sentiment is bearish, cryptocurrency prices rise, indicating that cryptocurrency can act as an alternative avenue for investment. Our results remain unaffected after controlling for potential factors that could impact cryptocurrency prices. }

After examining 13,918 tweets from January 2017 to January 2020, we find that negative sentiment is a predictive factor for Bitcoin returns, trading volumes, realized volatility, and jumps. In addition, only negative sentiment has a Granger-causal relation with volatility. We also find that Trump’s Twitter sentiment can influence the Bitcoin market in the form of time-varying dependence. This paper also extended the COVID-19 period and found that Trump’s sentiment can be a predictive tool to the Bitcoin market during the pandemic. Our results hold robust for alternative cryptocurrencies and offer insights about this market.}

We argue that sentiment subconsciously influences investor perception of potential merger synergies and risks, and therefore relates to bidder abnormal returns. We proxy daily sentiment based on Facebook status updates across seventeen international markets and show that there is a positive relation between sentiment and bidder announcement returns. In line with behavioral literature stating that sentiment more heavily influences uninformed traders, this relation is more pronounced in acquisitions with a low percentage of blockholder ownership, acquisitions of US public targets, and acquisitions of large targets relative to the size of the bidders. Our study goes beyond the conventional sentiment and stock market returns literature, uncovering a significant relation between sentiment and firm-specific abnormal returns to acquiring companies.}

We use sentiment analysis to model the effects of public sentiment toward investment markets in general, and cryptocurrencies in particular on crypto assets’ valuations. Our results show that investor sentiment can predict the price direction of cryptocurrencies, indicating direct impact of herding and anchoring biases.

The flow is attributable to one entity, clusters below round prices, induces asymmetric autocorrelations in Bitcoin, and suggests insufficient Tether reserves before month-ends. Rather than demand from cash investors, these patterns are most consistent with the supply-based hypothesis of unbacked digital money inflating cryptocurrency prices.},

The low barrier of entry and high data availability of the cryptocurrency market makes it an excellent subject of study, from which it is possible to derive insights into the behavior of markets through the application of sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques for the challenging task of stock market prediction. While there have been some previous studies, most of them have focused exclusively on the behavior of Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose the usage of common machine learning tools and available social media data for predicting the price movement of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin cryptocurrency market movements. We compare the utilization of neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) while using elements from Twitter and market data as input features. The results show that it is possible to predict cryptocurrency markets using machine learning and sentiment analysis, where Twitter data by itself could be used to predict certain cryptocurrencies and that NN outperform the other models.},

Since cryptocurrency is generated and consumed by Blockchain systems, Blockchain-specific information can be considered as the main component in forecasting the values of cryptocurrency. This perspective has been widely adopted in studies of Bitcoin price predictions. However, we find that Ethereum, a popular and leading cryptocurrency in the market, has Blockchain information that differs from that of Bitcoin. Hence, this study investigates the relationship between inherent Ethereum Blockchain information and Ethereum prices. Furthermore, we investigate how Blockchain information concerning other publicly available coins on the market is associated with Ethereum prices. Our key findings reveal that macro-economy factors, Ethereum-specific Blockchain information, and the Blockchain information of other cryptocurrency play important roles in the prediction of Ethereum prices.}

Specifically, we explore the conditional cross effects and volatility spillover between Bitcoin and financial indicators using different multivariate GARCH specifications. The nature of interaction between Bitcoin and financial variables and their transmission mechanisms are taken into account when analyzing the diversification and hedging effectiveness across gold asset and stock market. Our findings suggest that all models confirm the significant returns and volatility spillovers. More importantly, we find that VARMA (1,1)-DCC-GJR-GARCH is the best-fit model for modeling the joint dynamics of a variety of financial assets. We also show that a short position in the Bitcoin market allows hedging the risk investment for all different financial assets. Finally, hedging strategies involving gold, oil, equities and Bitcoin reduce considerably the portfolio's risk, as compared to the risk of the portfolio made up of gold, oil and equities only.}

(2015) and Twitter Happiness sentiment, applying the bivariate cross-quantilogram of Han et al. (2016). Happiness sentiment index significantly predicts Bitcoin return as well as other major cryptocurrencies at the two extreme states of the market and for extreme levels of sentiment. Hence, investors should readjust their portfolios according to the market sentiment and limit their decision on the safe-haven property of Bitcoin. As to FEARS, predictability also exists but is rather pronounced for a low level of sentiment. Overall, Happiness sentiment reveals to be a persistent and robust predictor for most cryptocurrency returns. FEARS index also shows significant predictability of returns, but the predictability is weaker and mainly in the short-term. In summary, our findings provide evidence that online investor sentiment is a significant nonlinear predictor for most major cryptocurrencies returns, suggesting though the superiority of Twitter to Google-based online investor sentiment proxy. Moreover, cryptocurrency returns seem to be driven more by sentiment transmitted through social media than with macroeconomic news, which is in line with the nature of cryptocurrency participants, mainly young individuals computer enthusiasts.}

Results show that Bitcoin behaves differently to traditional currencies. Traditional currencies typically experience a decrease in returns after negative news arrivals and an increase in returns following positive news whereas Bitcoin reacts positively to both positive and negative news. This suggests investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin irrespective of the sentiment of the news. This phenomenon is exacerbated during bubble periods. Conversely, cryptocurrency cyber-attack news and fraud news dampen this effect, decreasing Bitcoin returns and volatility. Our results contribute to the discussion on the nature of Bitcoin as a currency or an asset. They further inform practitioners about the characteristics of cryptocurrencies as a financial asset and inform regulators about the influence of news on Bitcoin volatility, particularly during bubble periods.}

Previous works model news pieces in bag-of-words space, which analyzes the latent relationship between word statistical patterns and stock price movements. However, news sentiment, which is an important ring on the chain of mapping from the word patterns to the price movements, is rarely touched. In this paper, we first implement a generic stock price prediction framework, and plug in six different models with different analyzing approaches. To take one step further, we use Harvard psychological dictionary and Loughran–McDonald financial sentiment dictionary to construct a sentiment space. Textual news articles are then quantitatively measured and projected onto the sentiment space. Instance labeling method is rigorously discussed and tested. We evaluate the models’ prediction accuracy and empirically compare their performance at different market classification levels. Experiments are conducted on five years historical Hong Kong Stock Exchange prices and news articles. Results show that (1) at individual stock, sector and index levels, the models with sentiment analysis outperform the bag-of-words model in both validation set and independent testing set; (2) the models which use sentiment polarity cannot provide useful predictions; (3) there is a minor difference between the models using two different sentiment dictionaries.}

This has led to a renewal of interest in digital currencies. Cryptocurrency, one of the most prominent digital currency has found itself in spotlight with investors wanting a piece of it and business establishments accepting it as a source of payment due to its stable performance in the last few years. This research has been done on predicting cryptocurrency prices using machine learning based neural network which has a lowest the model loss over 100 epochs during training and Technical Trade Indicators (TTI) graphs depicts a real BTC value 5 to 10 times in 300-days of current fiscal year has further supported this increasing trader confidence and a shift in global cryptocurrency graph by predicted BTC values. On the same lines, we are analyzing bitcoin prices using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis. We also study stock market trends in order to better predict bitcoin prices quantitatively. In this work we analyze the impact of global currencies like US Dollar, foreign exchanges on Bitcoin prices and whether Bitcoin has the stability to dethrone global currencies and become the single medium of transaction. This work is adequate to aid in predicting price and with results obtained from predicting Bitcoin prices using machine learning based neural network achieving an accuracy of 94.89\% under all circumstances of technical trade indication thereby bringing down its price prediction by over 13.7\% in April 2020 itself during evaluation.}

We use a comprehensive feature set, including technical, blockchain-based, sentiment-/interest-based, and asset-based features. Our results show that technical features remain most relevant for most methods, followed by selected blockchain-based and sentiment-/interest-based features. Additionally, we find that predictability increases for longer prediction horizons. Although a quantile-based long-short trading strategy generates monthly returns of up to 39\% before transaction costs, it leads to negative returns after taking transaction costs into account due to the particularly short holding periods.}

	ABSTRACT = {Cryptocurrencies lack clear measures of fundamental values and are often associated with speculative bubbles. This paper introduces a new way of testing for speculative bubbles based on StockTwits sentiment, which is used as the transition variable in a smooth transition autoregression. The model allows for conditional heteroskedasticity and fat tails of the conditional distribution of the error term, and volatility may depend on the constructed sentiment index. We apply the model to the CRIX index, for which several bubble periods are identified. The detected locally explosive price dynamics, given the specified bubble regime controlled by a smooth transition function, are more akin to the notion of speculative bubble that is driven by exuberant sentiment. Furthermore, we find that volatility increases as the sentiment index decreases, which is analogous to the commonly called leverage effect.},

Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7\% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 6\%.}

For each firm, two pieces of information are released on a weekly basis: experts' expectations about game outcomes through the betting odds, and the game outcomes themselves. The stock market reacts strongly to news about game results, generating significant abnormal returns and trading volumes. We find evidence that the abnormal returns for the winning teams do not reflect rational expectations but are high due to overreactions induced by investor sentiment. This is not the case for losing teams. There is no market reaction to the release of new betting information although these betting odds are excellent predictors of the game outcomes. The discrepancy between the strong market reaction to game results and the lack of reaction to betting odds may not only be the result from overreaction to game results but also from the lack of informational content or information salience of the betting information. Therefore, we also examine whether betting information can be used to predict short-run stock returns subsequent to the games. We reach mixed results: we conclude that investors ignore some non-salient public information such as betting odds, and betting information predicts a stock price overreaction to game results which is influenced by investors' mood (especially when the teams are strongly expected to win).}

In addition, academics increasingly acknowledge the predictive power of Twitter for a wide variety of events and more specifically for financial markets. This paper studies to what extent public Twitter sentiment can be used to predict price returns for the nine largest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar and TRON. By using a cryptocurrency-specific lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach, financial data and bilateral Granger-causality testing, it was found that Twitter sentiment has predictive power for the returns of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Using a bullishness ratio, predictive power is found for EOS and TRON. Finally, a heuristic approach is developed to discover that at least 1–\% of the obtained Tweets were posted by Twitter “bot” accounts. This paper is the first to cover the predictive power of Twitter sentiment in the setting of multiple cryptocurrencies and to explore the presence of cryptocurrency-related Twitter bots.}

The unpredictability of noise traders' beliefs creates a risk in the price of the asset that deters rational arbitrageurs from aggressively betting against them. As a result, prices can diverge significantly from fundamental values even in the absence of fundamental risk. Moreover, bearing a disproportionate amount of risk that they themselves create enables noise traders to earn a higher expected return than rational investors do. The model sheds light on a number of financial anomalies, including the excess volatility of asset prices, the mean reversion of stock returns, the underpricing of closed-end mutual funds, and the Mehra-Prescott equity premium puzzle.},

	abstract = { A new, evolutionary explanation of markets and investor behavior  Half of all Americans have money in the stock market, yet economists can't agree on whether investors and markets are rational and efficient, as modern financial theory assumes, or irrational and inefficient, as behavioral economists believe. The debate is one of the biggest in economics, and the value or futility of investment management and financial regulation hangs on the answer. In this groundbreaking book, Andrew Lo transforms the debate with a powerful new framework in which rationality and irrationality coexist-the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis. Drawing on psychology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and other fields,Adaptive Markets shows that the theory of market efficiency is incomplete. When markets are unstable, investors react instinctively, creating inefficiencies for others to exploit. Lo's new paradigm explains how financial evolution shapes behavior and markets at the speed of thought-a fact revealed by swings between stability and crisis, profit and loss, and innovation and regulation. An ambitious new answer to fundamental questions about economics and investing,Adaptive Markets is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how markets really work.  },

	abstract = {This research examines the semi-strong efficiency of Bitcoin in the Bitstamp and Mt.Gox markets, showing how the digital currency responds to monetary policy and Bitcoin events. On the one hand, we observe that Bitcoin has become more efficient over time in relation to its own events. On the other hand, Bitcoin is not affected by monetary policy news, highlighting the absence of any kind of control on Bitcoin. These findings are relevant for investors and policymakers since Bitcoin is a financial asset without any connection to the measures of central banks.}

	Abstract    = "Bitcoin, as the most popular cryptocurrency, has received increasing attention from both investors and researchers over recent years. One emerging branch of the research on bitcoin focuses on empirical bitcoin pricing. Machine learning methods are well suited for predictive problems, and researchers frequently apply these methods to predict bitcoin prices and returns. In this study, we analyze the existing body of literature on empirical bitcoin pricing via machine learning and structure it according to four different concepts. We show that research on this topic is highly diverse and that the results of several studies can only be compared to a limited extent. We further derive guidelines for future publications in the field to ensure a sufficient level of transparency and reproducibility.
