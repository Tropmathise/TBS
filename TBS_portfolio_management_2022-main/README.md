# Investment Management
This repository holds examples of code and data for the Portfolio/Investment Management course. The examples are organised by assignment, with each assignment getting its own folder. The `1_labs_introduction` folder contains several introductory example to help you get started with Python and Google Colaboratory.

To work with the examples in this repository, you should be able to run Python code on your computer. You can install Python locally or use a web-based tool, such as Google Colab. We use the latter for all examples and exercises in this course.

In addition, you are expected to have some familiarity with Python. If you have no prior experience with Python and struggle to follow the examples in this repo, consider first taking some of the tutorials/courses listed [here](http://python.berkeley.edu/resources/). Alternatively, by clicking this [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16J7KBFtVL2ALT42vhlHVnN-sJtwG0Igp?usp=sharing) button you can access a Colab notebook containing several relevant introductory examples.
